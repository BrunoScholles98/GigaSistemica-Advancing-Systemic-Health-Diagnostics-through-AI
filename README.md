# GigaSistêmica: Advancing Systemic Health Diagnostics through AI

## Overview
GigaSistêmica is a collaborative initiative between GigaCandanga and the University of Brasília (UnB), dedicated to leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to advance diagnostic and predictive capabilities for systemic health conditions. This project focuses on integrating dental imaging, radiomic analysis, and specialized language models to develop tools for early detection and efficient healthcare delivery. As part of our commitment to open science, this repository provides a central point for tracking our research progress and associated resources.

### Projects and Publications
Below is an overview of completed and ongoing projects under the GigaSistêmica initiative. The repository will be updated as new milestones are achieved.

### 1. GigaXReport: A Multimodal Diagnostic Framework with Specialized Language Models (SLMs)
- **Description:**  
  GigaXReport is a Flask-based web application that unifies three advanced AI pipelines for medical imaging analysis:
  1. **Osteoporosis Detection:** Uses an EfficientNet-B7 CNN (pretrained on mandibular cortical morphology) with Grad-CAM saliency maps to classify panoramic radiographs into “Healthy” vs. “Osteoporotic” categories.  
  2. **Carotid Atheroma Analysis:** Applies a FastViT classifier to screen for atheroma presence, a Faster R-CNN ONNX model for localization, and a DC-UNet segmentation network to precisely delineate calcifications.  
  3. **Multimodal Reporting (MedGemma):** Leverages Google’s MedGemma Small Language Model (SLM), a vision-language model, to generate detailed radiological reports in English or Portuguese, embedding the AI outputs verbatim under sections such as “Bone Health” and “Atheroma Diagnosis.”  
  The app produces an interactive combined visualization (original image, Grad-CAM overlay, detection/segmentation results) and compiles a professional PDF report with embedded figures and formatted text.

### 2. Osteoporosis Screening with Panoramic Radiographs
- **Description:**  
  An AI-based approach to identify signs of osteoporosis using dental panoramic radiographs (PR). EfficientNet-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were trained on PR images to classify mandibular cortical morphology into “Healthy” (C1) and “Osteoporotic” (C3) categories. Validation was performed against Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) results. Grad-CAM visualizations highlight critical regions such as the mandibular cortex.
